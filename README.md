# Machine-Learning-Model
Project Description: Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning
This project involves building a spam email detection model using a machine learning classifier. The goal is to classify emails (or text messages) as either "spam" or "not spam" based on their content. We'll use the following steps to implement the solution:

1. Dataset
We use a subset of the 20 Newsgroups dataset available from scikit-learn. This dataset contains text documents from different newsgroups. For our task, we focus on categories that have spam-like messages (e.g., soc.religion.christian, talk.religion.misc, sci.space, comp.graphics).

Text data: The actual content of the messages or emails.
Target variable: The labels (0 or 1) that represent whether a message is spam (1) or not (0).
2. Preprocessing
TF-IDF Vectorization: We convert the raw text data into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This technique gives us a measure of the importance of words in the documents while reducing the impact of less informative words. We use TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn for this purpose.
Stopwords removal: We remove common words (e.g., "the", "and", "is") to improve the model's focus on the important terms.
3. Model
We use a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) to classify the messages. Naive Bayes is a simple yet effective classification algorithm, especially for text-based data. It works by calculating the likelihood of a message belonging to each category (spam or not spam) based on the words it contains.

4. Training and Testing
Data Split: We split the dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Training: We train the Naive Bayes model using the training data.
Testing and Evaluation: We predict the labels for the test data and compare the predicted labels with the actual labels using several metrics.
5. Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the model using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model (the percentage of correct predictions).
Precision, Recall, and F1-score: These metrics help assess the performance of the model in classifying spam messages, particularly if the data is imbalanced.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the performance by showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
6. Visualization
The confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap, making it easy to understand the classification results in terms of both spam and non-spam messages.
Summary
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify text messages (emails, in particular) as spam or not spam. We accomplish this by preprocessing the text data, training a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluating its performance on a test set. Visualizations like the confusion matrix allow us to gain insights into the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
